## Overview
This course is intended to give students a foundational understanding of programming
in the statistical language R. This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever
you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:

* Exploring data with graphics and summaries
* Cleaning and preparing data for analyses
* Linking data sets together
* Organizing projects and creating reproducible research

By the end of this course you should feel *confident* approaching any data you encounter
in the future. We will cover virtually no statistics, however it is the intention that this course will
leave you prepared to progress in CSSS or STAT courses with the ability to focus on 
*statistics* instead of *coding*. Additionally, I hope the basic concepts you learn will be 
applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic and 
algorithmic thinking.

### Prerequisites
No specific courses are required and I anticipate this will be the first course in 
which most students encounter programming. Programming is difficult and can
be learned effectively only through time, effort, and exposure. Trial and error is a
key aspect of learning to code and you will *always* find yourself searching for 
answers or asking for help. Therefore the only prequisites for this course are the
capability to work hard at something difficult and a willingness to ask for help
and provide help when asked.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/)
[clanfear.github.io/SOC321/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of the slides, R
code, and assignments. It will be updated continually throughout the quarter, and 
available in full after the term has ended as a reference.

### Labs
Lab time is scheduled in [Savery 117](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/sav)
on Mondays from 3:30 to 5:20. Attendance is optional for labs and this time should be considered a form of extended
office hours and collaborative work time. You are highly encouraged to attend and ask questions
about homework, lectures, or programming in R in general.

### Extra Help

This course features both a Slack channel and a mailing list for obtaining extra help. As you 
develop your skills, you will find that learning *how* to ask questions well makes 
finding answers much easier. Please note that this course
has a large number of students but no teaching assistant, so students are encouraged
and expected to assist one another with technical problems, both in and out of class.
Diagnosing problems in others' code is a very effective way to improve your understanding of programming.

#### [Mailing List](mailto:csss508a_sp19@uw.edu)

This course features a mailing list for asking questions. I encourage
you to use this list as your primary means of answering *long technical questions*. To use the mailing list, address your email to `csss508a_sp19@uw.edu`
and it will be sent to the instructor and all students in the class. Unless you specifically
request otherwise, emailed questions directed to me ([clanfear@uw.edu](mailto:clanfear@uw.edu)) that may be useful to others in the class will be answered with a response to the class mailing list. 

#### [Slack Channel](https://uwcsss508.slack.com/)

We will also use a Slack channel for communication.
You may ask and answer questions in the Slack channel instead of the mailing list.
Slack is best-suited for *short technical questions* or *extended conversations*.
Your `@uw.edu` email must be used to register for the channel.

## Course Requirements
This course is graded as credit / no credit. To pass you need to receive 
at least 60% of the available points. There will be approximately 7 graded homeworks,
one nearly every week. There are 4 points possible for each week that features a homework.

### [Homework](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/docs/homework.html): 75% (3 points)
These must be turned in as knitted markdown documents which we will learn to create and for which
templates are provided. They will be graded on a 0 to 3 point scale based
on a simple effort-focused rubric found on the course website. These are designed
first and foremost to develop skills rather than "prove" you have learned concepts. 
I encourage you to communicate and work together, so long as you write and explain
your code yourself and do not copy work wholesale. You can learn a lot from replicating
others' code but you will learn nothing if you copy it without knowing how it works.

### [Peer Review](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/docs/peer_review.html): 25% (1 point)
Each week an assignment is due, students will be randomly assigned to grade another
student's assignment following the 0 to 3 rubric. They will be expected to provide
constructive feedback and commentary if something new was learned; reading others' 
code is an important skill and you will write better code knowing others will see it.
These reviews will be due midnight prior to the following class meeting.
Each peer review is worth 1 point and will be evaluated by the instructor on a binary
"good" / "not good" scale. 

## Course Texts
There are no texts you are required to purchase for this course. The main recommended
texts are available online:

* *[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)* by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham,
a great general introduction to R programming for data management and analysis.

Additional recommended readings will be posted on the website over the term. The following
books or resources are recommended and may prove useful. If purchasing, remember to shop around and
avoid previous editions as R is a constantly maturing language:

* *[Hands on Programming with R](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028574.do)* by 
Garrett Grolemund, an introduction to R focused on learning to program.


* [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): Handy reference 
sheets covering a variety of common R tasks and packages.

* [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/): A blog of news and tutorials about R with
multiple updates per day and thousands of archived posts.

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), the internet's largest programming help
community. Nearly any question you have about programming in R has probably already
been asked and answered here, and if not, this is the place to ask.

## Software
This is a course in R programming, so you will be expected to use R. You are welcome
to use lab computers, however R and RStudio are free software, so you are strongly
urged to use your own computer so that you will be more comfortable and have easy
access. In terms of R packages, this course will ephasize the [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org) family of 
packages for manipulating and displaying data. You can acquire R from the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and RStudio from
the [RStudio home page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (you want
the free RStudio desktop version). The instructor can provide support with installing
R or RStudio in office hours or over email.
