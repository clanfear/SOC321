## Overview
This course is intended to build practical skills in conducting quantitative 
analyses using programming and statistics. This knowledge is intended to be broadly useful wherever
you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:

* Cleaning and preparing data for analyses
* Exploring data with graphics and summaries
* Drawing conclusions from data using statistics
* Communicating findings visually and verbally

By the end of this course you should feel *confident* approaching any data you encounter
in the future. While it focuses on the R programming language, the programming concepts you learn will be 
applicable to other programming languages and research in general, such as logic, 
algorithmic thinking, and project management.

### Prerequisites
No specific courses are required and I anticipate this will be the first course in 
which most students encounter programming. Programming is difficult and can
be learned effectively only through time and effort. Trial and error is a
key aspect of learning to code and you will *always* find yourself searching for 
answers or asking for help. Therefore the only prerequisites for this course are the
capability to work hard at something difficult and a willingness to ask for help.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/)
[clanfear.github.io/SOC321/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of the slides, R
code, and assignments. It will be updated continually throughout the quarter, and 
available after the term has ended as a reference.

### Labs
Labs are in [Savery 117](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/sav)
on `lab_day` from `start_time` to `end_time`. Lab will consist of working through
code examples as well as question and answer sessions for homeworks and projects.
Lab attendance is mandatory. Using your own computer is recommended but computers
are provided in the lab.

### Extra Help

This course features both a Slack channel and a mailing list for obtaining extra help. As you 
develop your skills, you will find that learning *how* to ask questions well makes 
finding answers much easier. Students are encouraged
and expected to assist one another with technical problems, both in and out of class.
Diagnosing problems in others' code is a very effective way to improve your understanding of programming.

#### [Mailing List](mailto:mailing_list@uw.edu)

This course features a mailing list for asking questions. I encourage
you to use this list as your primary means of answering *long technical questions*. 
To use the mailing list, address your email to `mailing_list_address`
and it will be sent to the instructor and all students in the class. *Unless you specifically
request otherwise*, emailed questions directed to me ([clanfear@uw.edu](mailto:clanfear@uw.edu)) that may be useful to others in the class will be answered with a response to the class mailing list. 

#### [Slack Channel](https://slack_channel.slack.com)

We will also use a Slack channel for communication.
You may ask and answer questions in the Slack channel instead of the mailing list.
Slack is best-suited for *short technical questions* or *extended conversations*.
Your `@uw.edu` email must be used to register for the channel. You will receive 
an invitation in the first week of class.

## Course Requirements

There are 100 points available in the course, with the following breakdown:

| Item                   | Number | Points Each | Points Total |
|:----------------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Homework               |   5    |      5      |    25        |
| Code Review            |   4    |      3      |    12        |
| Lab Notebook           |   9    |      2      |    18        |
| Project Lightning Talk |   1    |     15      |    15        |
| Project Report         |   1    |     30      |    30        |

A score of at least 95 will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.5 points below 95 
will correspond to a .1 difference in the final grade (e.g. 90/100 is a 3.8).

### [Homework](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/docs/homework.html)
These must be turned in as knitted markdown documents which we will learn to create 
in the first weekand for which
templates are provided. Homework will be handed in as *both* a knitted HTML file
and an R Markdown document with all required code to produce the output document.
They will be graded on a 0 to 5 point scale based
on a simple *effort-focused* rubric found on the homework page. These are designed
first and foremost to develop skills rather than "prove" you have learned concepts. 
I encourage you to communicate and work together, so long as you write and explain
your code yourself and do not copy work wholesale. You can learn a lot from replicating
others' code but you will learn nothing if you copy it without knowing how it works.
Use of "found" or "borrowed" code is permitted only provided a citation.

### [Code Review](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/docs/code_review.html)
Each week an assignment is due, students will be randomly assigned to review another
student's assignment following the same rubric. They will be expected to provide
constructive feedback and commentary if something new was learned; reading others' 
code is an important skill and you will write better code knowing others will see it.
These reviews will be due midnight prior to the following class meeting.
Each peer review is worth 3 points and will be evaluated using the rubric on the code review page.

### [Lab Notebook](null)
In each lab, students will complete exercises in an R Markdown document. These exercises
will be turned in as both a knitted HTML document and the original R Markdown (.Rmd) file at the end of lab.
Each notebook is worth 2 points and is evaluated as complete (2), at least 50% complete (1), or less than 50% complete (0).

### [Projects](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/docs/project.html)
Students will choose from a diverse series of quantitative data sets and prepare an analytical report.
Projects will combine descriptive statistics, visualization, and statistical models in 
a readable format for the general population. The project features two components:
(1) a 3-minute lightning talk presentation in the last week of class and (2) a written report to be turned in
by `project_deadline`.

#### Lightning Talk

Lightning talks are 3-minute presentations accompanied by a single slide. They 
are an increasingly common format for presenting research in professional settings.
You will be expected to concisely summarize your research question, research design, and findings for
a general audience. 

#### Project Report

Project reports will be brief summaries of your research projects. 
They will include: 

* An brief introduction describing the research question with a brief 
literature review
* A methods section describing analysis techniques
* A results section with appropriate visual and tabular results with interpretations
* A brief conclusion

Project reports will be submitted as two files like homework assignments: (1) a knitted HTML file with no
visible raw code and (2) an R Markdown file with all necessary code
embedded in the document. Reports must be 
between 2500 and 5000 words and feature between 2 and 5 figures or tables. 

## Course Texts

The textbooks for this course are all available freely online as digital versions.
Print versions are available---and affordable---if desired.

* *[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)* by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham,
a great general introduction to R programming for data management and analysis.

* *[Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/stat/index.php?stat_book=isrs)* by David Diez, Christopher Barr, and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, a free and open-source introduction to statistics using R. This text focuses on programming over mathematical derivation.

* *[Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](http://socviz.co/)* by Kieran Healy, an introduction
to visualizing data and R programming.

Additional recommended readings will be posted on the website over the term.

## Resources

The following resources are recommended and may prove useful.

* [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers): Interactive web-based
tutorials for R using modern approaches.

* [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): Handy reference 
sheets covering a variety of common R tasks and packages.

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), the internet's largest programming help
community. Nearly any question you have about programming in R has probably already
been asked and answered here, and if not, this is the place to ask.

## Software
This is a course in programming and statistics using R. You are welcome
to use lab computers, however R and RStudio are free software, so you are encouraged
to use your own computer for familiarity and accessibility. In terms of R packages, 
this course will emphasize the [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org) family of 
packages for manipulating and displaying data. You can acquire R from the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and RStudio from
the [RStudio home page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (you want
the free RStudio desktop version). [Installation instructions may be found here](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC321/docs/installation.html).
The instructor can also provide support with installing
R or RStudio in office hours or over email or Slack.

## Course Outline

> This course outline is preliminary and based on a schedule with two lectures and a
