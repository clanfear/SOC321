* [R for Data Science online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) textbook by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. One of many good R texts available, but importantly it is free and focuses on the [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages which form the backbone of this course.
* [Introduction to R Workshop](https://youtu.be/HbFaPArTIjo), recorded Oct. 11, 2018, with [companion webpage](https://clanfear.github.io/Intro_R_Workshop/).
* [Intermediate R Workshop](https://youtu.be/pSWaOOniVBk), recorded Jan. 31, 2019, with [companion webpage](https://clanfear.github.io/Intermediate_R_Workshop/).
* [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://whattheyforgot.org/) by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester. Great information on best practices for managing projects and R itself.
